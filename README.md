Do you remember the opening shot of the movie oppenheimer(2023)? In case you don't, it is a static shot of water ripples on a water surface. There is alot of speculation about the interpretation of this shot. Some say that it mimics the ripple caused by a bomb drop and the other say it is a refernce to the raman split experiment. I myself am not sure about Nolan's interpretation of that shot. All I thought was that it would be a cool project to replicate. Apparently, I am not the only one who thought that. [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160418004149/http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm) is an archive webpage of the algorithm that helps help simulate this idea and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZUdGqeOD0w&t=710s&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) is a code along video that I found in youtube.
